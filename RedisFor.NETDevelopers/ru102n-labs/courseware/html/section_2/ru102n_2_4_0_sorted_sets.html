<h1>Sorted Sets</h1>

<p>
    Sorted Sets are similar conceptually to sets, however unlike regular sets, sorted sets 
    store and retrieve members in order using the member's score. In this section we'll learn
    how to use Sorted Sets using the StackExchange.Redis library. We'll learn how to add to,
    combine, move between, and enumerate members with sorted sets.
