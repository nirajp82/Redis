<h1>The IServer</h1>

<p>
    The <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IServer</span> is an abstraction to a single instance of a Redis Server. You can grab an instance of an <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IServer</span>
    by using the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IConnectionMultiplexer.GetServer</span> command, passing in the exact endpoint information you want to
    retrieve. 
</p>
<p>
    <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IServer</span> has a fundamentally different role than <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IDatabase</span> as you're going to use it to handle the server
    level commands. That means that in general, data modeling commands are not appropriate to be used on a server. Rather
    operations like checking the server's info (the basic info of Redis), it's configuration, updating it's configuration,
    checking memory statistics, and the like are <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IServer</span> operations. Even scanning for the keys of a Redis server should be
    done at the server level.
