<h1>Connect to Redis Sentinel</h1>

<p>
    Connecting to <a href="https://redis.io/docs/management/sentinel/">Redis Sentinel</a>
    is a bit different than connecting to other instances of Redis. 
</p>
<p>    
    The key
    difference is that rather than connecting to the master server, you connect
    to one of the 'sentinels' - the instances of Redis responsible for monitoring
    your master and replicas, detecting fail-overs, and promoting new masters.

    Additionally, you must specify the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">ServiceName</span>, which corresponds
    to the master name that you tell the sentinels to monitor when configuring them.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    var options = new ConfigurationOptions
    {
        EndPoints = new EndPointCollection{"sentinel-1:26379"},
        ServiceName = "sentinel"
    };

    var muxer = ConnectionMultiplexer.Connect(options);
