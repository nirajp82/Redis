<h1>Querying Documents in Redis OM</h1>

<p>
    In this section, we'll be looking at how to query documents that have been inserted in to Redis using Redis OM. There are three ways to
    query our documents in Redis OM.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Using The RedisCollection's LINQ API</li>
    <li>Directly using ID or Key Name</li>    
    <li>Using the Low-Level <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IRedisConnection.Search</span> API</li>
</ul>

<p>
    In this section we'll primarily be focusing on LINQ, but we'll very briefly cover the other two ways here.
</p>

<h2>Querying with LINQ</h2>

<p>
    Querying with LINQ revolves around using the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IRedisCollection&lt;T&gt;</span>, this works like most <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IQueryable</span> types where
    it collects predicates to build out the query and then materializes when enumerated (e.g. a call to <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">ToList</span> or <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">ToArray</span>).
    Supported LINQ methods include:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Where</li>  
    <li>Select</li>  
    <li>OrderBy</li>
    <li>OrderByDescending</li>
    <li>Skip</li>
    <li>Take</li>
    <li>Any</li>
    <li>First</li>
    <li>FirstOrDefault</li>
    <li>Single</li>
    <li>SingleOrDefault</li>
    <li>Count</li>    
</ul>

<p>
    These methods work as you'd expect them to if you've ever used an IQueryable interface before. However, there are a couple of key
    caveats to make around the Selects and OrderBy predicates. Selects will work best with fields that have been indexed. OrderBy predicates
    will only work on fields that have been marked sortable. So if we go into our <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">Employee</span> model, we can update the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IndexedAttribute</span>
    above the Name property to set it to Sortable:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    [Indexed(Sortable = true)]
    public string? Name { get; set; }
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Querying by Id or Key</h2>

<p>
    Probably the simplest way to query a document in Redis is to use its Id or Key Name. You can use either just the Id, or the complete key name,
    whichever is preferable for you. To query this you would just use the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IRedisCollection&lt;T&gt;.FindById</span> methods, passing in
    either the Id or Key, the Collection is smart enough to construct a key regardless of which you end up using in your query.
</p>

<h3>Querying with the Raw Search API</h3>

<p>
    You can still perform strongly typed searches using the Raw Search API, to do this you would invoke <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">IRedisConnection.Search&lt;T&gt;</span>
    method, this takes a <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">RedisQuery</span> object which you can initialize in line with the arguments in <a href="https://redis.io/commands/ft.search/"><span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">FT.SEARCH</span></a>.
</p>
<p>
    By using the generic, you are able to pull back your results as strongly typed objects.
