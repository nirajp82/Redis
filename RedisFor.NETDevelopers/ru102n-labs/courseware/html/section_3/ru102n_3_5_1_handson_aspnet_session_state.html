<h1>Hands-On with Session State in ASP.NET</h1>

<p>
    In this Hands-On, we'll be exploring how to do Session State Management in ASP.NET.
    You'll likely want to open up the csproj file and checkout the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;"><i>starting-point</i></span>
    before proceeding, unless of course you'd prefer to build everything from scratch.
</p>
<p>
    The csproj file is located at <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">/src/section_3/section3.5/section3.5.csproj</span>. 
</p>
<p>
    It's highly recommended that you use Visual Studio or Rider for this Hands-On.
</p>

<h2>State of the Application Pre-Redis</h2>
<p>
    Similarly to how Session State Management works in ASP.NET Core, ASP.NET has a very direct, native pattern for handling Session State, and
    a simple way to add Redis as the provider of the Distributed Session State. 
</p>
<p>
    First let's look at the state of the application without Redis
    as it's Session State.
</p>

<p>
    This application is simply a boiler plate ASP.NET MVC app, the template that ships out of the box when you create an MVC project with Visual
    Studio with a minor exception.
</p>
<p>
    The contents of <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;"><i>Views/Home/Index.cshtml</i></span> have been replaced with:
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    @{
        ViewBag.Title = &quot;Home Page&quot;;
    }
    
    &lt;div class=&quot;jumbotron&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;ASP.NET Distributed Session State with Redis&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;Our Session Says the meaning of life is: @Session[&quot;the meaning of life&quot;].&lt;/p&gt;    
    &lt;/div&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    Which simply displays <i>the meaning of life</i> key in the Session State. Now, on the Controller side, updating the Session State is 
    also quite trivial, you simply need to set the Session State key of your choosing. If you take a look at the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">Index</span> method
    in <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;"><i>Controllers/HomeController.cs</i></span> you'll see a single line of code interacting with the Session State to set our <i>the meaning of life</i>
    key.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    Session["the meaning of life"] = 42;
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Adding Redis as the Session State Provider</h2>

<p>
    Adding Redis here is dead simple. First off you need to add the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;"><i>Microsoft.Web.Redis.RedisSessionStateProvider</i></span> package to your
    application, we've already taken care of this for you.
</p>
<p>
    Then in the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;"><i>Web.config</i></span> file, you'll need to add the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">sessionState</span> settings
    inside of the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;">&lt;system.web&gt;</span> tag, add the following below the <span style="font-family: 'courier new', courier;"><i>&lt;!-- Add Session State Here --&gt;</i> mark in the <i>Web.config</i></span> file.
</p>

<pre>
<code>
    <sessionState mode="Custom" customProvider="MySessionStateStore">
        <providers>        
          <add name="MySessionStateStore" type="Microsoft.Web.Redis.RedisSessionStateProvider" host="localhost" accessKey="" ssl="false" />
        </providers>
      </sessionState>     
</code>
</pre>

<p>
    After doing that, you can run the app by hitting F5, and when the browser launches (to <a href="http://localhost:49982/">http://localhost:49982/</a>)
    you'll see that the session still works. The only difference being that Redis is now the provider for the Session State.
