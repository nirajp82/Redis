Explicit Pipelining with IBatch refers to a programming approach for interacting with a Redis database, specifically through the use of batches and the IBatch interface. In this context, a batch is a way to group multiple commands together and send them to Redis as a single, contiguous block. This can be beneficial for certain scenarios, such as when you want to ensure that all commands within the batch are executed sequentially without interleaving with other commands from the client.

The process involves the following steps:

1. **Create a Batch**: Instead of sending individual commands directly to the Redis server, you use the `IDatabase.CreateBatch()` method to create a batch. This method returns an object that represents the batch.

2. **Add Commands to the Batch**: Once you have the batch object, you use its async methods to add commands to the batch. These commands are not immediately dispatched to the Redis server.

3. **Dispatch Commands**: The term "dispatch" here refers to the actual sending of commands to the Redis server. However, it's important to note that the tasks (commands) within the batch are not immediately dispatched when you add them. The true dispatching occurs later in the process.

4. **Execute the Batch**: The `IBatch.Execute()` method is called to initiate the dispatch of the commands to the Redis server. It is only after this method is called that the commands are truly sent to Redis. Any attempt to await the tasks before calling `Execute` may lead to accidental deadlocks, so it's crucial to follow the sequence.

5. **Await Tasks After Execution**: After calling `IBatch.Execute()`, you can then await the tasks associated with the commands. This ensures that you wait for the completion of the batched commands.

The advantage of using explicit pipelining with batches is that it allows you to control the grouping of commands more intentionally, ensuring that they are executed together without interleaving with other client commands. This can be beneficial for scenarios where sequential execution of commands is important, and it provides a level of control that might not be achievable with implicit pipelining or individual command execution.

```cs
 var options = new ConfigurationOptions
 {
     EndPoints =
 {
     "localhost:6379"
 }
 };

 var muxer = await ConnectionMultiplexer.ConnectAsync(options);
 var db = muxer.GetDatabase();
 var pingTasks = new List<Task<TimeSpan>>();
 IBatch batch = db.CreateBatch();
 var stopWatch = Stopwatch.StartNew();
 for (var i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
 {
     pingTasks.Add(batch.PingAsync());
 }
 batch.Execute();
 await Task.WhenAll(pingTasks);
 Console.WriteLine($"1000 batched commands took: {stopWatch.ElapsedMilliseconds}ms to execute, first result: {pingTasks[0].Result}");
```
