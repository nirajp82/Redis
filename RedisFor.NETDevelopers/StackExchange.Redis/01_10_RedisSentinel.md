Redis Sentinel provides high availability for Redis when not using Redis Cluster.

Redis Sentinel also provides other collateral tasks such as monitoring, notifications, Automatic failover and acts as a configuration provider for clients.

Redis Sentinel is a distributed system designed to monitor and manage Redis instances, which are widely used as an in-memory data store and cache. Redis is known for its high performance, flexibility, and simplicity, but it lacks built-in high availability and failover mechanisms. Redis Sentinel addresses this limitation by providing a solution for automatic failover and monitoring.
