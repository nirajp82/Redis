Connecting to an OSS ("Open Source Software") Cluster instance is the same as connecting to a standalone Redis Instance.

Connecting to a Redis Cluster involves utilizing multiple endpoints to ensure continuous connectivity even in case of endpoint failures. This approach ensures redundancy and fault tolerance, allowing the connection to remain active despite potential disruptions.

**Key Points:**

1. **Multiple Endpoints:** Unlike standalone Redis instances, connecting to a Redis Cluster requires specifying multiple endpoints. This redundancy ensures that if one endpoint becomes unavailable, the connection can be redirected to another endpoint, maintaining connectivity.

2. **ConnectionMultiplexer:** The ConnectionMultiplexer is a crucial component in managing connections to a Redis Cluster. It handles the communication with the cluster, automatically redirecting connections to available endpoints when necessary.

3. **ConfigurationOptions:** The ConfigurationOptions object allows you to configure the connection parameters, including the list of endpoints. This object provides flexibility in tailoring the connection behavior to your specific requirements.

4. **Example Configuration:** The provided example demonstrates the ConfigurationOptions object with multiple endpoints. The EndPoints property specifies three endpoints, "redis-1:6379", "redis-2:6379", and "redis-3:6379". If one of these endpoints fails, the ConnectionMultiplexer will attempt to connect to the remaining endpoints, ensuring uninterrupted connectivity.
