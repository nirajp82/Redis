#### Nodes: 

In a Redis Cluster, nodes are individual Redis instances forming the cluster. Each node is responsible for a subset of the 16384 slots. Nodes communicate with each other to share information about slots and keys, enabling distributed data management.

#### Slots: 

Redis uses hashing to map keys to slots. There are 16384 slots in total. Each key belongs to a specific slot, determined by a hash function applied to the key. Slots are distributed across nodes, ensuring even data distribution in the cluster.

* Formula for Slots per Node:

Slots per Node = Total Slots / Total Nodes

Slots per Node =  16384 (Total Slots)/ Total Nodes

#### Logical Databases:
Redis supports multiple logical databases within a single Redis server. Each database is identified by an index number (from 0 to 15 by default) and operates independently of others. You can switch between databases using the SELECT command. Logical databases are useful for separating different types of data or isolating data for different applications within the same Redis instance.

#### Relationship between Logical Database, Nodes, and Slots:

* Each node is responsible for a subset of the keyspace, which is divided into 16384 slots.
* Each logical database is mapped to a subset of the slots.
* When a client performs a Redis operation on a key in a logical database, the operation is sent to the node that is responsible for the slot that the key belongs to.

For example, let's say we have a Redis cluster with three nodes and two logical databases. The following diagram shows how the keyspace is divided among the nodes and logical databases:

  * Node 1: Logical database 0 (slots 0-5119), Logical database 1 (slots 8192-13311)
  * Node 2: Logical database 0 (slots 5120-8191), Logical database 1 (slots 13312-16383)
  * Node 3: Replicates both logical databases

If a client performs a Redis operation on the key username in logical database 1, the operation will be sent to node 1, since node 1 is responsible for slot 16384 (which is the slot that the key username belongs to).

If a client performs a Redis operation on the key password in logical database 0, the operation will be sent to node 2, since node 2 is responsible for slot 0 (which is the slot that the key password belongs to).
