#### Nodes: 

In a Redis Cluster, nodes are individual Redis instances forming the cluster. Each node is responsible for a subset of the 16384 slots. Nodes communicate with each other to share information about slots and keys, enabling distributed data management.

#### Slots: 

Redis uses hashing to map keys to slots. There are 16384 slots in total. Each key belongs to a specific slot, determined by a hash function applied to the key. Slots are distributed across nodes, ensuring even data distribution in the cluster.

* Formula for Slots per Node:

Slots per Node = Total Slots / Total Nodes

Slots per Node =  16384 (Total Slots)/ Total Nodes

#### Logical Databases:
Redis supports multiple logical databases within a single Redis server. Each database is identified by an index number (from 0 to 15 by default) and operates independently of others. You can switch between databases using the SELECT command. Logical databases are useful for separating different types of data or isolating data for different applications within the same Redis instance.

#### Relationship between Logical Database, Nodes, and Slots:

* Each node is responsible for a subset of the keyspace, which is divided into 16384 slots.
* Each logical database is mapped to a subset of the slots.
* When a client performs a Redis operation on a key in a logical database, the operation is sent to the node that is responsible for the slot that the key belongs to.

Consider a Redis Cluster with 3 nodes (Node A, Node B, Node C). Each node is responsible for approximately 16384/3 = 5461 slots.

Nodes and Slots: Slots are distributed across nodes. For instance:

Node A: Slots 0-5460
Node B: Slots 5461-10921
Node C: Slots 10922-16383

Let's say we have two logical databases, db0 and db1, in Node A. A key "user:1234" hashes to slot 5678, which belongs to Node A. Depending on the selected logical database, the key "user:1234" can be stored in different databases:

- If `SELECT 0` is executed: 
  ```
  127.0.0.1:6379[0]> SET user:1234 "John"
  ```

  This sets the key "user:1234" with value "John" in logical database 0 of Node A.

- If `SELECT 1` is executed:
  ```
  127.0.0.1:6379[1]> SET user:1234 "Alice"
  ```

  This sets the key "user:1234" with value "Alice" in logical database 1 of Node A.

In this way, the relationship between logical databases, nodes, and slots allows for a flexible and scalable organization of data within a Redis Cluster. Different nodes handle different slots, and each node can have multiple logical databases, providing both sharding and data separation capabilities.
