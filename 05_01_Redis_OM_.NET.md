Redis Object Mapper (Redis OM) for .NET is a tool that facilitates the storage and retrieval of objects in Redis, a popular in-memory data store. It provides a way to model your .NET objects in a form that can be seamlessly stored and queried within Redis. Let's break down the key aspects of Redis OM in .NET:

1. **Object Modeling:**
   - Define your classes in C# that represent the data you want to store in Redis. In your example, you have `Employee`, `Sale`, and `Address` classes.

2. **Attributes:**
   - Use special attributes to provide instructions to Redis OM on how to handle your classes.

   - **DocumentAttribute:**
     - Decorate your class with this attribute.
     - Specifies how Redis should store and index the data, including storage type (JSON recommended), key prefix, and index name.

   - **RedisIdFieldAttribute:**
     - Marks the ID field for your model.
     - If an ID is present, it is used; otherwise, Redis OM generates one using a strategy (such as ULID).

   - **IndexedAttribute:**
     - Marks fields for sorting or querying.
     - Applicable to various data types (strings, enums, numbers, locations, and other classes).
     - Allows specifying the depth of the object tree to index or specific paths for searching.

   - **SearchableAttribute:**
     - Enables full-text search on a string field stored in Redis.
     - Useful for finding text matches.

3. **Key Prefix:**
   - Optionally set a key prefix to organize and limit indexing in Redis.

4. **Index Name:**
   - Optionally set an index name for easier identification in Redis.

By applying these attributes to your classes, Redis OM understands how to store the data in Redis and allows you to query it using LINQ.

Overall, Redis OM simplifies the integration of .NET objects with Redis, providing a more natural and object-oriented way to work with data in Redis. It abstracts away much of the underlying complexity, allowing developers to focus on their application logic rather than low-level Redis interactions.
