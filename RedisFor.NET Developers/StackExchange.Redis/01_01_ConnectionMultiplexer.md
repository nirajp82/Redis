The most fundamental architectural feature of StackExchange.Redis is Connection Multiplexing.

**Fundamental Feature: Connection Multiplexing**
- **Key Component:** ConnectionMultiplexer class is central to StackExchange.Redis, ConnectionMultiplexer class is responsible for arbitrating all connections to Redis, and routing all commands we want to send through the library through a **single connection**.
- **Number of Connections:** he ConnectionMultiplexer opens exactly 2 connections per Redis Server, one of which is the interactive command connection to Redis, the other being the subscription connection for the pub/sub API.
- **Alignment with Redis Architecture:** StackExchange.Redis uses a single connection multiplexer to manage all connections to Redis. This means that even if you send multiple commands concurrently, they will all be sent through the same connection. Sending additional commands concurrently doesn't help much because Redis can only process one command at a time. This means that even if you send multiple commands concurrently, they will still be queued up and processed one after the other.  Number of connections managed by the connection multiplexer matches the number of command threads in Redis. Since Redis only has one command thread, there is no need to open multiple connections. So this design of StackExchange.Redis aligns with Redis's single-threaded architecture. It uses a single connection because Redis's command processing is inherently single-threaded. Since Redis only has one command thread, there is no need to open multiple connections.

ConnectionMultiplexer hides away the details of multiple servers. Because the ConnectionMultiplexer does a lot, it is designed to be shared and reused between callers. You should not create a ConnectionMultiplexer per operation. It is fully thread-safe and ready for this usage.

**Benefits:**
 ConnectionMultiplexer is highly performant and robust, efficiently pushing commands to Redis.
 
1. **Matching Redis Threads:**
   - The single connection multiplexer matches the cardinality of Redis Threads. There's only one command thread in Redis, so sending additional commands concurrently doesn't help much as they will be waiting to be serviced by the command thread.

2. **Socket Optimization:**
    It minimizes the number of sockets application needs to open and maintain and wards off Socket Exhaustion.  Sockets are communication endpoints used for data transfer between your application and Redis.

3. **Automatic Command Pipelining:**
    The multiplexer will maximize usage of your sockets, and automatically pipeline commands sent concurrently.
   - Command pipelining is an optimization technique that allows multiple commands to be sent to Redis without waiting for each response. This is particularly beneficial for applications that send a large number of commands to Redis. By automatically pipelining commands, the multiplexer significantly reduces latency and improves throughput.  In a traditional request-response model, each command sent from the client to the server would typically require a separate round-trip for each command, with the client waiting for the server's response before sending the next command. Pipelining allows multiple commands to be sent to the server in a batch without waiting for individual responses.

**Tradeoffs:**
1. **Head-of-Line Blockages:**
   - Large payloads can cause blockages, delaying other requests.

2. **Blocking Commands:**
   - Blocking commands, like stream reads, cannot be used as they would block the interactive connection.
  
3. **Transaction Differences:**
   - Transactions operate differently, with limited support for watches, and commands aren't dispatched to Redis until execution time.
